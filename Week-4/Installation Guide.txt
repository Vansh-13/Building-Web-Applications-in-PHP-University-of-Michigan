Setting up your PHP/MySql Devlopment Environment
In this page, you will install a programmer text editor, install a bundled all-in-one PHP/MySql application, and explore that application briefly.

We have separate pages for each of the commonly used Operating Systems:

Setting up the MAMP PHP/MySql Environment on a Macintosh:https://www.wa4e.com/software-mac.php
Setting up the MAMP PHP/MySql Environment on a Windows :https://www.wa4e.com/software-mamp.php
Setting up the XAMPP PHP/MySql Environment in Microsoft Windows :https://www.wa4e.com/software-win.php

I Reccomend Xampp For Windows
You can use any software you like - I've done most of my demos using MAMP on the Macintosh so using MAMP might be easier on Windows. If you encounter a problem getting MAMP to work on Windows, it is OK to use XAMPP.
